Refer to upload app section to see how this can be done.<br>Use the app_url of the uploaded apps you want to install in the Desired Capabilities while running test on BrowserStack. <br>> Note: The app you want to test will be your main app, and the apps your main app depends on will be the `otherApps`.                             	|
| Uninstall packages                  	| adb uninstall package                                                                                                                	| You don't have to explicitly uninstall an app after you're done with your tests.
